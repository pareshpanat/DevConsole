### Community Post (Discord/Reddit)

Built a web app called DevConsole with a 53-tool catalog (including Coder AI, API testing, query builders, and one-time secret links). Looking for product feedback from developers: https://www.devconsole.org

## Accuracy Guidance

- Use **"50+"** in broad external messaging (matches site metadata)
- Use **"53 links in docs catalog"** when referring to this documentation set
- For privacy wording, avoid claiming every feature is fully local: some modules call remote services (for example Coder AI, blog APIs, secret creation endpoint)
