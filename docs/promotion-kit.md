## Feature Callouts for Launch Pages

## Trust/Clarity Notes

When promoting, keep language aligned with live claims:

- Use "50+ tools" in public copy
- Mention that repo inventory currently lists 53 utilities
- Avoid claiming server-side privacy for features that call remote APIs (for example, AI chat, blog APIs, one-time secret service)
